Post 2:  
Drawing stars
1.  I needed to create a starry sky.  Each star is identified by its position (x,y) in the space.
So each star is drawn calling the function point(x,y), by giving corresponding x, y coordinates as parameters.
2. For the astronaut, I used an image as shown below. The PImage library of processing is used to provide functionalities with the image.
