More Details:

To draw a start I need 3 values, x co-ordinate, y coordinate and since our stars are moving their speed. 
The best way to store all these is using 3 arrays. X, Y, speed

Then writing a loop that runs for 'no of stars' times will do our job. 
Every time the loop runs, we draw a star, subtract some value from each x. How many pixels each star is moved depends upon its speed value. 
int i = 0;
  while(i < 100) {
    point(x[i], y[i]);
    x[i] = x[i] - speed[i];
    if(x[i] < 0) {
      x[i] = width;
    }
    i = i + 1;
  }


Speed array is initialised with random values during the setup. 
So the speed with which a star moves is constant but which stars moves with which speed is random.
